# Automate-all-the-things
Any AppleScripts or Python scripts I write for my own personal benefit

## Meeting Reminder
I'm the VP of Scheduling & Communications on the Drexel University Peer Counseling Helpline; as such, I send a lot of emails about meetings and such. I put together this apple script to automate the process.

## Parser
I was given an principal components analysis output....... **copy-pasted** into Excel. I decided to write a Python script to tidy it.
